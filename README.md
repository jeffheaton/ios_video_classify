A simple IOS application that uses MobileNet to classify 1,000 different images from an IOS device's video camera.  This program is covered in 
greater detail in [Module 13.5](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/t81_558_class_13_05_edge.ipynb) of my deep learning course.
